# Setup

1. make main.tf file
2. put in region name, ami (find in ec2 instances -> launch instance) and instance type i.e t2.micro, t3.micro
3. `terraform init` to Set up Terraform in this folder
4. `terraform plan` to Show what it will do
5. `terraform apply` to Actually launch the EC2 instance (type 'yes' to confirm)
6. `terraform destroy` to destroy


# To use s3 + dynamodb versioning

## Delete S3

```
aws s3 rm s3://your-tf-state-bucket --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://your-tf-state-bucket --force
```

## Delete DynamoDB

```
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name terraform-lock
```

## Clean up tf state

### TL;DR
Delete the infra resources with `terraform destroy`
Empty the S3 buckets: delete all versions of the objects
Toggle the `Show versions` toggle button, check all the objects in the shown buckets
Delete the bootstrap resources (S3 + dynamodb) with `terraform destroy`

To safely delete your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table (used for Terraform remote state) before your 12-month AWS Free Tier ends, follow this step-by-step checklist:

ðŸ§¹ Step 1: Clean up your infrastructure
Before deleting the backend, destroy any infrastructure that uses the S3/DynamoDB remote backend:

```
terraform destroy
```

ðŸ§¯ Step 2: Disable the remote backend temporarily
If you're using a backend "s3" block in your main.tf or backend.tf, Terraform won't let you delete the backend resources while still using them. So you need to:

ðŸ›‘ Temporarily switch to local backend:
Comment out or remove this block:

hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-tf-state-bucket"
    key            = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-southeast-3"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
  }
}
Then reinitialize:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init -migrate-state
This will move the state back to local (creates terraform.tfstate locally).

ðŸ—‘ Step 3: Delete the S3 bucket
If you enabled force_destroy = true in your Terraform code:

hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tf_state" {
  bucket = "your-tf-state-bucket"
  force_destroy = true
}
You can just run:

```
terraform destroy
```

If not, delete it manually:

Option A: AWS CLI

```
aws s3 rm s3://your-tf-state-bucket --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://your-tf-state-bucket --force
```

Option B: AWS Console
Go to S3 > your bucket

Empty the bucket

Then click Delete bucket

ðŸ—‘ Step 4: Delete the DynamoDB Table
AWS CLI:

```
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name terraform-lock
```

Or AWS Console:
Go to DynamoDB > Tables

Select your terraform-lock table

Choose Actions > Delete table

âœ… Final Check
Make sure the state file is now local (terraform.tfstate)

Make sure all infra is destroyed

Make sure no S3 bucket or DynamoDB table remains

Nothing left = Nothing to charge for
